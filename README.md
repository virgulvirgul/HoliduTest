# HoliduTest

Coding test app for Holidu

============

Used frameworks and libraries:
 - Moya — Network abstraction layer written in Swift, simple and powerful tool to write good designed network layer.
 - RxSwift — Reactive Programming in Swift, a way for a simple and powerfull async code in my case
 - Nuke — small image loader, but here I failed, cause connection not secured and link has no file extension, need to search for workourands.
 - Yalta — is an intuitive and powerful Auto Layout library. In my case I need a fast way to make views, so prefer to do it with this library.

 ============

Next steps: 
 - Fix search quering, case it now working every character enetered, so make some delay and watch for old network connections maybe.
 - Update model classes, look for which fields are optinal and which not
 - Fix image loading
 - Check if app is work in landscape mode correctly
 - Polish design stuff
