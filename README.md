# HoliduTest

Coding test app for Holidu

============

Using frameworks and libraries:
 - Moya — Network abstraction layer written in Swift, simple and powerful tool to write good designed network layer.
 - RxSwift — Reactive Programming in Swift, a way for a simple and powerfull async code in my case
 - Nuke — small image loader, but here I failes, cause connection not secured and link has no extension
 — Yalta — is an intuitive and powerful Auto Layout library. In my case I need a fast way to make views, so prefer to do it with this library.
